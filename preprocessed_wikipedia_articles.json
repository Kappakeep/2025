example place different piece tactic concern immediate maneuver two aspect gameplay completely separated strategic goal mostly achieved tactic tactical opportunity based previous strategy play endgame

purpose based experience usually pawn considered worth one point knight bishop three point rook five point value difference rook bishop knight known exchange queen nine point king valuable piece combined since checkmate loses game still capable fighting piece endgame king generally powerful bishop knight le powerful rook basic value modified factor like position piece eg advanced pawn usually valuable initial square coordination piece eg pair bishop usually coordinate better bishop knight type position eg knight generally better closed position many pawn bishop powerful open position another important factor evaluation chess position pawn structure sometimes known pawn skeleton configuration pawn chessboard since pawn least mobile piece pawn structure relatively static largely determines strategic nature position weakness pawn structure include isolated doubled backward pawn hole created often permanent care must therefore taken avoid weakness unless compensated another

application data data accumulated operation database created initialized populated need maintained various database parameter may need changing database may need tuned tuning better performance application data structure may changed added new related application program may written add application functionality etc sometimes desired bring database back previous state many reason eg case database found corrupted due software error updated erroneous data achieve backup operation done occasionally continuously desired database state ie value data embedding database data structure kept within dedicated backup file many technique exist effectively decided database administrator bring database back state eg specifying state desired point time database state file used restore state static analysis technique software verification applied also scenario query language particular abstract interpretation framework extended field query language relational database way support sound approximation technique semantics query language tuned according suitable abstraction concrete domain data abstraction relational database system many interesting application particular security purpose finegrained access control watermarking etc dbms feature might include increasingly call single system incorporates core functionality build test deployment framework database management source control borrowing development software industry market offering devops database first task database designer produce conceptual data model reflects structure information held database common approach develop entityrelationship model often aid drawing tool another popular approach unified modeling language successful data model accurately reflect possible state external world modeled example people one phone number allow information captured designing good conceptual data model requires good understanding application domain typically involves asking deep question thing interest organization like customer also supplier product sold two different form packaging product different product plane fly new york dubai via frankfurt one flight two maybe even three answer question establish definition terminology used entity customer product flight flight segment relationship attribute producing conceptual data model sometimes involves input business process analysis workflow organization help establish information needed database left example help deciding whether database need hold historic data well current data produced conceptual data model user happy next stage translate schema implement relevant data structure within database process often called logical database design output logical data model expressed form schema whereas conceptual data model theory least independent choice database technology logical data model expressed term particular database model supported chosen dbms term data model database model often used interchangeably article use data model design specific database database model modeling notation used express design popular database model generalpurpose database relational model precisely relational model represented sql language process creating logical database design using model us methodical approach known normalization goal normalization ensure elementary fact recorded one place insertion update deletion automatically maintain consistency final stage database design make decision affect performance scalability recovery security like depend particular dbms often called physical database design output physical data model key goal stage data independence meaning decision made performance optimization purpose invisible endusers application two type data independence physical data independence logical data independence physical design driven mainly performance requirement requires good knowledge expected workload access pattern deep understanding feature offered chosen dbms another aspect physical database design security involves defining access control database object well defining security level method data database model type data model determines logical structure database fundamentally determines manner data stored organized manipulated popular example database model relational model sql approximation relational us tablebased format common logical data model database include objectrelational database combine two related structure physical data model include model include specialized model optimized particular type data database management system provides three view database data typically one conceptual internal view data number different external view allows user see database information businessrelated way rather technical processing viewpoint example financial department company need payment detail employee part company expense need detail employee interest human resource department thus different department need different view company database threelevel database architecture relates concept data independence one major initial driving force relational model idea change made certain level affect view higher level example change internal level affect application program written using conceptual level interface reduces impact making physical change improve performance conceptual view provides level indirection internal external one hand provides common view database independent different external view structure hand abstract away detail data stored managed internal level principle every level even every external view presented different data model practice usually given dbms us data model external conceptual level eg relational model internal level hidden inside dbms depends implementation requires different level detail us
